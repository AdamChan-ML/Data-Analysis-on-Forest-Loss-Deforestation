# Data-Analysis-on-Forest-Loss-Deforestation
This is a data analysis project on forest loss and deforestation by using PowerBI. 

## Objectives:
To identify the loss of forest due to environmental issue and implement a statistical model to determine the relationship between the possible drivers of deforestation and loss of forest based on years and locations. 

## Scopes:
- To analyse and visualize the change of forest loss impacted by deforestation globally based on years by using Analytical Dashboard (OLAP).
- To develop a linear regression model to determine the relationship between the forest loss and the possible drivers of deforestation in order to implement suitable conservation  planning. 

### Notes:
- Public datasets are used in this project. (datasets link are included in the repository/documentation.)
- When PowerBI file is downloaded, please download the datasets as well and check/change the data source in the PowerBI file to have a better experience. 
- There might be an error as our data source might be different.
